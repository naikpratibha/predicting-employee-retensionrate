# Salifort Motors Employees Retension Rate

# Overview

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model to predict whether an employee of salifort motors company will quit the company or not. It utilises the data collected from current emplyers of the company. Metrics results from random forest classification and XGB Classifier model are reliable with accuracy score 90% and 92% respectively. satisfaction level and number of project completed by the employee are found to important parameters for predicting results.

# Business Understanding

Through the result of the predictive machine learning model would improve employee satisfaction rate. If you can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.

# Data Understanding

Data has been collected from current emplyees , it comprises of information about satisfaction level, evalaution score, department of the employer, number of projects etc. it have information about 15000 different employee working with 10 features. which were further be classifiered by feature engineering into 13 features. satisfaction level and number of project completed by the employee are found to important parameters for predicting results. below is a barplot for representation of number of project quit job or not.

# Modeling and Evaluation

A XGBClassifier model used for prediction is utilising 30 different model for the predictions. here is the metrics score for different models used during evalution:

and plot for most significant features for predictions:

# Conclusion

Model would help company to predict employee retension rate beforehand which would help to rationaly utilise resources and conduct future interviews for new hires. number of projects and satisfaction score has been obsereved playing major role for predictions company can focus more on the model results and improve emplyee satisfaction.
